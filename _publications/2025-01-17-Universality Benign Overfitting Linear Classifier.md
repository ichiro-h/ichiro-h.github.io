excerpt: 'This work provides a comprehensive study of benign overfitting of for linear maximum margin classifiers, discovers a phase transition for the noisy model which was previously unknown and provides some geometric intuition behind it. We further considerably relax the required covariate assumptions in both, the noisy and noiseless case. Our results demonstrate that benign overfitting of maximum margin classifiers holds in a much wider range of scenarios than was previously known.'

This work provides a comprehensive study of benign overfitting of for linear maximum margin classifiers, discovers a phase transition for the noisy model which was previously unknown and provides some geometric intuition behind it. We further considerably relax the required covariate assumptions in both, the noisy and noiseless case. Our results demonstrate that benign overfitting of maximum margin classifiers holds in a much wider range of scenarios than was previously known.
